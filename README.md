tests
=====

My laziness has finally been beaten and I have made myself up to make a repository
for my tests directories.

This is pretty much the idea: every time I need to try out something new, I tend
to make a small "minimal" test of it. It can be literally about anything; maybe
something I am developing in Shogun and want to try out from the libshogun (C++)
or python interface, I am trying to figure out how to do something with Eigen,
with Boost, with NumPy, ROS, etc.

The main idea of this repository is to help me synchronize these tests amongst the
machines I am normally working with. Moreover, it would be awesome if any of them
turns out to be useful for anyone!

Do not hesitate to fire an issue if you any class of comment or suggestion.
Also, I am looking forward to seeing contributions from other people's tests, so
make me glad with and send me a pull request if you have any :-)
